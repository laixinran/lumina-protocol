# Lumina Protocol
Cross-chain luminous messaging with commemorative NFTs via Hyperlane

âœ¨ Illuminating hearts across the multiverse âœ¨

## Overview
Lumina Protocol is a cross-chain social communication platform that enables users to send emotionally-resonant messages across different blockchain networks while automatically minting commemorative NFTs upon successful delivery. Built on Hyperlane's interoperability infrastructure, Lumina transforms traditional messaging into a meaningful, permanent, and cross-chain social experience that connects communities across blockchain boundaries.
Features

ðŸŒ‰ Cross-Chain Messaging: Send messages from Base Sepolia to Ethereum Sepolia using Hyperlane
ðŸ’« Emotional Resonance: Choose from 6 resonance types (Love, Bliss, Serenity, Luminosity, Eternity, Grace)
ðŸŽ¨ Automatic NFT Minting: Commemorative NFTs are automatically minted on the destination chain
âœ… Bidirectional Confirmation: Automatic confirmation system verifies message delivery
ðŸ”— Permanent Storage: All messages and metadata stored entirely on-chain
ðŸ–¤ Minimalist Design: Clean, terminal-inspired interface focusing on meaningful communication

## How It Works

Connect your wallet to Base Sepolia
Compose your luminous message (max 280 characters)
Choose an emotional resonance type
Send across chains via Hyperlane infrastructure
Receive automatic NFT confirmation on Ethereum Sepolia
